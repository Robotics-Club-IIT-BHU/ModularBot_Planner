# ModularBot_Planner
This is to make learn a decentralized planning algorithm for a big cluster of modular bots

## ToDo
- [ ] Choosing a modular bot platform and making mechanical design of a approximate system.
- [ ] Get Shape Shifting and basically control algos for a small cluster
- [ ] Representation of the following in smaller clusters and decentralizing the algo
- [ ] Main Planning algorithms for a given task
- [ ] Add more ........
